tured with safety to tbe student’s habits of sslf-reliance
or substantial progress in study. The references are to
the grammate of Allen, Allen and Greenough, Andrews
and Stoddard, Bullions and Morris, and Harlmess; with
occasional references to Madvig and Zumpt.

The great favor with which the earlier editions of the

work were received, induced the editor to endeavor to ,

make it still more acceptable. The N otes were accord·

ingly entirely rewritten, and such alterations and im-
provements introduced as were suggested either by able

tenebere, or the editor's enlarged experienoe.

The edition now offered contains a tboroughly revised Α

and improved Lexicon, presented in a large and more

attractive type. Parts of the verb of less obvious deri-
vation have been added, and a few words omitted in
former editions have been inserted in their proper places.
The definitions bave been made as few and concise as
was consistent with clearness. A multitude of defini·

tions, which an experienccd translator might find service·
able,is apt to bewilder and perplex-young students.
The quantity of all syllables, not obvious by position,
and not that of the penult merely, has been indicated
in the usual way. The Personal and Geograpbical in·
denes will be found to contain sufficient informationem
the subjects of which they treet.
