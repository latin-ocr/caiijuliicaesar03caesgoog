PREFAGE.

-οοκζοο-

ΗΕ text of the Commentaries hero presented is
· chiefly that of Kraner‚ in the Tauchnitz editions
of Latin classice. In a few instances, however, the read·
ing of Oehler or Nipperdey seemed preferable, and was
accordingly adopted. This portion of the work received,
as it merited, not the least amount of care and attention,
and it is hoped that whatever improvements have been
introduced into the text by the learning and research
of the ablest scholare of Germany, will be found in the
present edition.

The Notes have been prepared with a very simple
view: to give the willing and industrious student that
kind of assistance which is really necessary to render
his study profitable‚ and that amount which the nature
'of the 'study fully entitles him to expect; to remove
difficulties greater than his strength; and to give him
directly, or refer him to the sources of such information
as is requisita to a thorough understanding of the author.
In particular the subjunctive mood‚ and tho infinitivo
with a subject accusative -constructions which practi-
cal teaohers find most fertile in difficulties to the young
student—have receivedadue share of attention. With
the explanatione of those subjecte and the grammatical

references given in the Notes, it is believed that as much -

hasbeen done in the way of elucidation as can be ven-¹
